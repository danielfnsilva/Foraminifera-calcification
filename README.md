This repository contains code used to generate a custom calibration curve for HPTS (8-Hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt), a ratiometric pH fluorophore used to track cellular pH modulation. Additionally, this repository includes code to visualize ambient and cellular pH and to model proton fluxes.
